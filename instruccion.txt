Act as a Senior .NET 8 Developer specializing in Blazor Server and Clean Architecture.

I need to refactor the caching mechanism in my project `FacturasSRI`. Currently, `FacturasSRI.Infrastructure/Services/DataCacheService.cs` is trying to write `.json` files to the `wwwroot` folder to cache Customers and Products. This is causing errors in my production environment (Render.com / Linux) because the file system is ephemeral and read-only.

**Task:**
Refactor `FacturasSRI.Infrastructure/Services/DataCacheService.cs` to use `Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory.IMemoryCache` instead of `System.IO` file operations.

**Requirements:**
1.  **Remove File I/O:** Delete all logic related to checking, reading, or writing `customers.json` or `products.json`.
2.  **Inject IMemoryCache:** Update the constructor to inject `IMemoryCache`.
3.  **Implement Cache-Aside Pattern:**
    Create generic or specific methods to retrieve data. The logic should be:
    - Check if data exists in Memory Cache.
    - If YES: Return data from cache.
    - If NO: Execute a fallback function (passed as a parameter, e.g., `Func<Task<List<T>>>`) to fetch data from the Database, store it in Cache with a sliding expiration of 1 hour, and return it.
4.  **Keys:** Use constants for cache keys (e.g., "KEY_CUSTOMERS", "KEY_PRODUCTS").
5.  **Invalidation:** Provide methods to explicitly clear/remove the cache for Customers or Products (to be called when a new user or product is created).
6.  **Thread Safety:** Ensure the implementation is thread-safe using standard .NET 8 practices.

**Context:**
- The project is Blazor Server .NET 8.
- The service is located in the Infrastructure layer.
- I need to cache lists of `CustomerDto` and `ProductDto`.

Please provide the full, refactored code for `DataCacheService.cs`.
